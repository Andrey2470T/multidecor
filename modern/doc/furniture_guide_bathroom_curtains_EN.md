# Bathroom Curtains

In order to place the bathroom curtains you need to do the following:
* Place the plastic cornice at some wanted height. Also to move the curtains place one more cornice at the same height by clicking at one of sides of the first cornice.
* Place the curtain with rings straightely beneath one of the cornices above by clicking on its bottom.
* Place the curtain (already without rings) beneath the curtain with rings. Also place one more if you want.

Now you can move the whole curtain consisting of a few blocks along the cornice by clicking that.
