# Decorating

Means the glueing wallpapers and plastering.
You can place any wallpaper node clicking on the walls surfaces. To strip off punch them by the scaper in your wieldhand.
For plastering you need to wield the spatula item and to the right from that the plaster as shown on the screenshot. You can plaster only on the ceiling.
