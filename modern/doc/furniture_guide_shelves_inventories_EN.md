# Shelves Inventories

Multidecor uses the flexible shelves system which can be attached to any furniture item at some position. The sign of the item has a shelf is the visible door/drawer objectref presense. Although it can not have neither that nor another and then the item should be just clicked as a ordinary chest like the closed wooden shelves have.

The furniture shelves and their detached inventories exist independently from each other and will be removed only when the node is removed which they are attached to.
As an additional benefit of using objects for showing the shelves is an opportunity to smoothly moving/rotating them is what the mod does.

To open the shelf inventory just hover over its object (door or drawer) or click the node if it doesn't have the objects and that inventory of the given shelf will be shown. Note, the shelves system also has the locking feature allowing to restrict the access to some shelf to only the owner (the player who placed it) or some group of players. To lock the shelf click the top-right button with the lock image. If you want to provide access for someone, click the below the button 'Share' and enter names of those players. After locking, you will see the infotext on the node showing who is an owner and group if it is.
